<h1>Image Segmentation Project</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Image Segmentation Project. This project provides a Python function for image segmentation using OpenCV. The function takes in an image and returns the same image with a bounding box drawn around the largest contour in the image.</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>In order to use this function, you will need to have the following packages installed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>imutils</li>
  <li>gradio (optional, for launching the function as a web app)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>You can use the <code>segment</code> function by importing it into your Python script and calling it on an image like this:</p>
<pre><code>from image_segmentation import segment

//read in an image
image = cv2.imread("image.jpg")

//segment the image
segmented_image = segment(image)

//show the segmented image
cv2.imshow("Segmented Image", segmented_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also launch the <code>segment</code> function as a web app using Gradio by running the following code:</p>
<pre><code>import gradio as gr

iface = gr.Interface(fn=segment, inputs="image", outputs="image")
iface.launch(share=True)
</code></pre>
<p>This will start the web app locally and provide a URL that you can use to access the app in your web browser.</p>
<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<p>The function uses the Sobel gradient operator to compute the gradient of the image in the x and y directions, and then subtracts the y-gradient from the x-gradient to create a binary image. It then applies morphological transformations to close small gaps in the image and extract the largest contour. Finally, it draws a bounding box around the contour and returns the original image with the bounding box drawn on it.</p>
