# Welcome to the Barcode localization Project

This project provides a Python function for image segmentation using OpenCV. The function takes in an image and returns the same image with a bounding box drawn around the largest contour in the image.

Dependencies
In order to use this function, you will need to have the following packages installed:

OpenCV
imutils
gradio (optional, for launching the function as a web app)
Usage
You can use the segment function by importing it into your Python script and calling it on an image like this:

Copy code
from image_segmentation import segment

# read in an image
image = cv2.imread("image.jpg")

# segment the image
segmented_image = segment(image)

# show the segmented image
cv2.imshow("Segmented Image", segmented_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
You can also launch the segment function as a web app using Gradio by running the following code:

Copy code
import gradio as gr

iface = gr.Interface(fn=segment, inputs="image", outputs="image")
iface.launch(share=True)
This will start the web app locally and provide a URL that you can use to access the app in your web browser.

Additional Notes
The function uses the Sobel gradient operator to compute the gradient of the image in the x and y directions, and then subtracts the y-gradient from the x-gradient to create a binary image. It then applies morphological transformations to close small gaps in the image and extract the largest contour. Finally, it draws a bounding box around the contour and returns the original image with the bounding box drawn on it.
